# Ops Daily Import: False positive on validated subprocess call
# All inputs (mode, files) are validated before subprocess.run():
# - mode is whitelisted to ("auto", "files")
# - files array is validated: basename only, no path traversal, .xlsx extension only
# - Additional validation in orchestrator (scripts/daily_import_ops.py)
